## Project Plan
GauSim is developed to efficiently and physically augment autonomous driving scenes for robust and secure ADAS, it will add more features in the near future!
- [x] Add moving cars and static obstacles.
- [x] Physically change the car colors.
- [ ] Support LiDAR point cloud initialization.
- [ ] Handle dynamic scenes, including moving cars and pedestrain.
- [ ] Effectiveness evaluation of downstream tasks.
- [ ] Combine kinematics to generate novel car motion.
